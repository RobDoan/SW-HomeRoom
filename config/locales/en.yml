# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      anxiety: 'Anxiety'
      addiction: "Anxiety refers to strong feelings of unease, worry and fear. Because
          occasional anxiety is a normal human experience, it's sometimes hard to
          know when it's becoming a mental health problem â€“ but if your feelings of
          anxiety are very strong, or last for a long time, they can be overwhelming"
      depression: 'Depression is a feeling of low mood that lasts for a long time and affects
                   your everyday life. It can make you feel hopeless, despairing, guilty,
                   worthless, unmotivated and exhausted'
